The nodes of the grapth represent the cities that are available while the edges represent
the cities that are connected (ie. Roads). Using the cities in USCities.csv, the nodes of 
the graph can be put in place. Then, using the connectedCities.csv file, the edges can be 
inserted.
In order to find any path from Boston to Minneapolis, either a depth first or beadth first
path search algorithm can be used.

3.2
The breadth first searh algorithm found the result in fewer steps. If the number of stops 
increased, the BFS method would still find fewer steps to the destination versus the DFS.  
This is because a BFS searches for paths that are as close to the starting node as possible,
whereas a DFS searches for any path that can connect to the destination, since it goes 
through all connected nodes first to see if the destination is possible from all nodes. 

3.4
The complexity of the algorithm is O((v+e) log (v)), where v is the number of verticies and e is the number of edges.
The complexity of the problem would remain the same if the number of cities, stops, or 
restaurants increased. This is because graph algorithms are created in such a way that the
time it takes to run the algorithm is proportional to the inputs given.
