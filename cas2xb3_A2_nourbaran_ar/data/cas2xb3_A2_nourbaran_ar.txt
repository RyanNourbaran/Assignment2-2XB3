March 31, 2018. All work done is my on BostonToMinneapolis.java and Tests is my own.

Decisions:

I created my own ADT, BostonToMinneapolis, that contains all the methods and builds required for the assignment.
This way, I could enter my own data in without having to change much of the original Digraph,DFS and BFS classes.
In order to run the assignment, simply run the main method in the BostonToMinneapolis class.
Also, the references library algs4.jar should be used, as many of the classes use this library.
